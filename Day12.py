#Inheritance

"""
You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:

A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
A string, firstName.
A string, lastName.
An integer, id.
An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.
A char calculate() method that calculates a Student objectâ€™s average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:
Grading Scale

Sample Input::
Heraldo Memelli 8135627
2
100 80

Sample Output::
Name: Memelli, Heraldo
ID: 8135627
Grade: O
